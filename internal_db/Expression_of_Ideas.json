    "paragraph": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: Some powerful works of literature have so influenced readers that new legislation has been passed as a result. The Int eresting Narr ative of the Li fe of Olaudah Equiano  (1789) is the autobiography of a man who endured slavery on both sides of the Atlantic. Equiano’s book contributed to the passage of the Slave T rade Act of 1807. The Jungle  (1906) is a fictional work by Upton Sinclair that describes unsanitary conditions in US meatpacking plants. Sinclair’s book contributed to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. The student wants to emphasize a difference between the two books. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
    "question": "Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Although both are powerful works of literature that contributed to new legislation, Equiano’s book is an autobiography, while Sinclair’s is fictional.",
      "B": "They may have written about different topics, but Equiano and Sinclair both influenced readers.",
      "C": "The 1807 Slave T rade Act resulted in part from a book by Equiano, while the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act resulted in part from a book by Sinclair.",
      "D": "The Int eresting Narr ative of the Li fe of Olaudah Equiano  and The Jungle  are two works of literature that contributed to new legislation (concerning the slave trade and food safety, respectively)."

    "paragraph": "Alexander Lawrence Posey (1873–1908) varied his focus and tone depending on the genre in which he was writing. In his poetry, he used heartfelt language to evoke the beauty and peacefulness of his natural surroundings; in his journalism, ____ he employed humor and satire to comment on political issues affecting his Muskogee Creek community.",

      "C": "similarly,",
      "D": "by contrast"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. This sentence compares two examples of Posey's tone: the 'heartfelt language' he used in his poetry versus the 'humor and satire' he used in his journalism. We know from these descriptions and from the claim in the previous sentence that the two tones are very different from each other. So the transition 'by contrast' fits the context perfectly.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in other words. But the text isn't restating the first example here. Instead, it's offering a second, totally different example.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means 'admittedly.' But the text isn't admitting or conceding anything here. Instead, these two examples work together to support the claim made in the first sentence.\n\nChoice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But these two examples are intentionally very different from each other, so 'similarly' doesn't make sense here."

    "paragraph": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: The Azores is a group of islands about 870 miles off the coast of Portugal. Historians have long believed that in the fifteenth century Portuguese mariners were the first humans to populate the Azores. A 2015 study coauthored by Sofia Gabriel and Maria da Luz Mathias found that Vikings from Scandinavia may have populated the Azores as early as the ninth century. The researchers found a genetic connection between house mice in the Azores and house mice in Scandinavia. House mice may have traveled from Scandinavia to the Azores on Viking ships. The student wants to specify who may have first populated the Azores, according to the 2015 study. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D effectively specifies who may have first populated the Azores according to the 2015 study: the Vikings. Choice A is incorrect as it only mentions the historical belief that the Portuguese were first, while the 2015 study drew a different conclusion. Choice B casts doubt on the Portuguese claim but doesn’t name the group of people who may have arrived before the Portuguese. Choice C mentions the evidence that the researchers found but not the conclusion they drew from it. It doesn’t name the possible group of people who may have arrived before the Portuguese."
