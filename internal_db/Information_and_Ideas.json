    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer. The singular possessive pronoun 'its' agrees with the singular antecedent 'the animal' and indicates that the 'young' belong to it. Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. 'They’re' is a contraction of 'they are', a plural pronoun and verb, but the antecedent 'the animal' is singular. Also, we don’t need the extra verb 'are' — we already have a main verb in this clause, so adding 'are' would be confusing and ungrammatical. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. 'Their' is a plural pronoun, but the subject of the sentence is 'the animal', a singular noun. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a confusing and ungrammatical sentence. 'It’s' is a contraction for 'it is'. We already have the verb 'nurses' in this clause, so we shouldn’t add the verb 'is'."

In this choice, the period after 'percent' is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence ('After ... percent') and another ('Such ... up'). Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction 'and' can't be used in this way to join sentences. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence.

Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. The phrase 'according to Swentzell' is an aside that interrupts the flow of the sentence, so it needs to be separated from the sentence with a pair of matching punctuation marks. We already have a comma at the beginning, so we have to use another comma here to match. We can't just switch to a dash."

    "paragraph": "The first computerized spreadsheet, Dan Bricklin’s VisiCalc, improved financial recordkeeping not only by providing users with an easy means of adjusting data in spreadsheets but also by automatically updating all calculations that were dependent on these ______. Prior to VisiCalc’s release, changing a paper spreadsheet often required redoing the entire sheet by hand, a process that could take days.",
    "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "adjustments prior",
      "B": "adjustments, prior",
      "C": "adjustments. Prior",
      "D": "adjustments and prior"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between the first sentence ('The...adjustments') and the second sentence ('Prior...days'). Because the adverbial phrase beginning with 'prior' indicates when changing a spreadsheet required redoing the sheet by hand, that phrase belongs with the second sentence. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. Two sentences are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction 'and' can't be used in this way to join the sentences."

    "explanation": "Choice C is correct as it maintains the appropriate format for introducing a name and profession without unnecessary punctuation.

It correctly places the modifying phrase 'Although they are widely accessible, cost-effective, and simple to use' immediately before the noun it modifies, 'synthetic fertilizers,' clearly indicating that the fertilizers—and not another noun in the sentence—are being described. Choice A is incorrect as it creates a misplaced modifier with 'there' illogically seeming cost-effective and simple to use.

To express general facts (and also to match the simple present tense of 'use'), we should use the simple present tense form 'measures'. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses the past perfect tense, but the previous sentence tells us that the tool is currently used to measure things, so the past tense doesn't make sense for this verb. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses the future perfect conditional tense, but the previous sentence tells us that the tool is currently used to measure things, so the future tense doesn't make sense for this verb.

It correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause ('Zephyrus had an unexpected encounter with dragons') and the supplementary phrase ('the one who breathes fire'). This punctuation usage conforms to the conventions of Standard English. Choice A is incorrect because it creates a run-on sentence without appropriate punctuation.

In this choice, the past progressive tense verb 'was studying' is consistent with the other past tense verbs used to describe Buratti’s discovery. Furthermore, the past progressive tense correctly indicates that an ongoing action in the past was occurring (she was studying) at the same time that another event occurred in the past (she made an interesting discovery). Choice A is incorrect because the present tense verb 'studies' isn’t consistent with the past tense verbs used to describe Buratti’s discovery.

This supplementary element functions to define the term “photosynthesis,” and the pair of commas indicates that this element could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.

This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction 'but' to join the first main clause ('Human-made...fibers') and the second main clause ('the manufacture...water'). Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses.

In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (“Defying…fast”) and another sentence that begins with a supplementary phrase (“During…Olympics”). Choice A is incorrect as using another dash (“fast—during”) to mark the boundary between sentences creates a potentially confusing sentence. In this context, a period, semicolon, or colon would be clear and more conventional. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence.

      "A": "claiming",
      "B": "claim",
      "C": "having claimed",
      "D": "to claim"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of finite and non-finite verb forms within a sentence. A main clause requires a finite verb to perform the action of the subject (in this case, “some historians”), and this choice supplies the finite present tense verb “claim” to indicate what some historians do. Choice A is incorrect because the non-finite participle “claiming” doesn’t supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice C is incorrect because the non-finite participle “having claimed” doesn’t supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice D is incorrect because the non-finite to-infinitive “to claim” doesn’t supply the main clause with a finite verb."

      "D": "is a smaller, foam version"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement and agreement between nouns. The singular verb “is” and the singular noun “version” both agree in number with the relative pronoun “which.” In this context, “which” functions as a singular subject because it refers to the singular noun “the Nerf football.” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not agree in number with the singular noun phrase “the Nerf football” that they’re modifying."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense. In this choice, the past perfect verb 'had doubled' properly indicates that the doubling of the organization's initial membership occurred during a specific period before the present (between the organization's founding in 1967 and the end of the 1990s). Choice A is incorrect because the present perfect verb 'has doubled' doesn't indicate that the organization's doubling of its initial membership occurred during a specific period in the past. Choice C is incorrect because the present tense verb 'doubles' doesn't indicate that the organization's doubling of its initial membership occurred during a specific period in the past. Choice D is incorrect because the future tense verb 'will double' doesn't indicate that the organization's doubling of its initial membership occurred during a specific period in the past."
