    "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?",

      "A": "value, but",

      "C": "value,",
      "D": "value but"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of independent clauses within a sentence. An independent clause is a phrase containing a subject and a verb that can stand on its own as a sentence. This choice uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction “but” to join the first independent clause (“underlines…lower a book’s value”) and the second independent clause (“such markings…can be a gold mine to scholars”) to create a compound sentence."

    "paragraph": "In an investigative project, a student compiled the following notes: Most spider webs exhibit remarkable tensile strength and flexibility. Led by researcher Emma Carlton, a group aimed to explore the underlying mechanics of these qualities. Carlton's group crafted synthetic webs in their lab that mimicked the structural design of natural spider webs. They specifically examined intersections where threads meet. Upon applying force to these synthetic webs, the points of intersection increased, enhancing the web's overall rigidity.",
    "question": "What was the primary objective of the research project as outlined by the student's notes?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Carlton’s group sought to understand the mechanics behind spider webs' remarkable tensile strength and flexibility.",
      "B": "The team created synthetic webs to examine thread intersections and observed how they reacted under stress.",
      "C": "The researchers observed that adding force to the webs increased their rigidity at the intersections of threads.",
      "D": "According to the notes, spider webs are known for their flexibility and tensile strength as natural structures."
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A accurately summarizes the primary goal of the research project, which is to understand the underlying mechanics of spider webs’ tensile strength and flexibility. Choice B describes the methodology rather than the objective. Choice C details a finding from the study rather than its primary aim. Choice D merely restates a noted property of spider webs without addressing the research objective."

    "paragraph": "Artisan Monica Jenkins creates exquisite, handcrafted pottery using a unique blend of clay sourced from local quarries. Employing a technique passed down through generations, Jenkins meticulously molds each piece by hand, ensuring that no two items are exactly alike. Her commitment to traditional craftsmanship shines through in every delicate detail.",
    "question": "In the passage, the word 'exquisite' is used to describe Jenkins' pottery. What does this word suggest about her creations?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Expensive and mass-produced",
      "B": "Large and sturdy",
      "C": "Beautiful and finely crafted",
      "D": "Unremarkable and ordinary"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the correct answer because the word 'exquisite' implies that Jenkins' pottery is beautiful and finely crafted. The passage describes her pottery as handcrafted, with each piece meticulously molded by hand, indicating a high level of craftsmanship. This aligns with the idea of something being exquisite, suggesting that Jenkins' creations are of exceptional quality and beauty."

    "paragraph": "One aspect of in-person shopping that online shopping can’t replicate is the opportunity to touch a product before buying it. Does this difference matter? In an experiment, researchers asked one group of participants to touch a mug and a toy, while another group was prohibited from touching the two items. The participants were then asked how much money they’d pay for the items. People who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than were people who weren’t allowed to touch the items. This finding suggests that ______",
    "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "people who mainly shop online probably spend more money every month than people who mainly shop in person do.",
      "B": "in-person shopping may make products seem more valuable than they seem if only viewed online.",
      "C": "retailers with in-person and online stores should charge the same price for a given product in both places.",
      "D": "online retailers may be able to raise the prices they charge for products that are only available online."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The text suggests that 'people who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than people who weren’t allowed to touch the items.' This implies that being able to interact with a product in person may make it seem more valuable to a shopper."

    "paragraph": "Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was a prominent classical music composer from England who toured the US three times in the early 1900s. The child of a West African father and an English mother, Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry. For example, he referred to himself as Anglo-African. ______ he incorporated the sounds of traditional African music into his classical music compositions.",
    "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "In addition,",
      "B": "Actually,",
      "C": "However,",
      "D": "Regardless,"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. 'In addition,' logically signals that the detail in this sentence—that Coleridge-Taylor included traditional African music in his classical compositions—adds to the information in the previous sentence. Specifically, the previous sentence indicates one way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry, and the claim that follows indicates a second, additional way. Choice B is incorrect because 'actually' illogically signals that the detail in this sentence is surprising in light of the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating a second, additional way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry. Choice C is incorrect because 'however' illogically signals that the detail in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating a second, additional way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry. Choice D is incorrect because 'regardless' illogically signals that the detail in this sentence is true despite the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating a second, additional way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry."

    "paragraph": "In a remote village nestled deep in the mountains, a mysterious alchemist conducted a peculiar experiment with a withered orchid. Initially, the flower seemed unaffected by the elixir, merely resting atop the liquid's surface. But soon, a remarkable alteration began to unfold. The shriveled petals stirred and gradually assumed a richer hue, as if awakening from a dormant state.",
    "question": "As used in the passage, what does the word 'peculiar' most likely mean?",

      "D": "Familiar"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the correct answer because in the context of the passage, 'peculiar' suggests something unusual or out of the ordinary. The passage describes an alchemist conducting an experiment with a withered orchid, indicating an unconventional or strange occurrence. The word 'peculiar' aligns with the idea of the experiment being unusual or unfamiliar."
