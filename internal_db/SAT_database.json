        "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer. The subject of the modifier 'fortifying soil in arid ecosystems against erosion' is 'biocrusts.' Subject-modifier placement requires a modifier and its subject to be next to each other, so 'biocrusts' or some variant meaning 'biocrusts' (in this case, 'these crusts') must begin the missing clause.

        "paragraph": "Sam Maloof (1916–2009) was an American woodworker and furniture designer. He was the son of Lebanese immigrants. He received a “genius grant” from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in 1985. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, owns a rocking chair that Maloof made from walnut wood. The armrests and the seat of the chair are sleek and contoured, and the back consists of seven spindle-like slats. The student wants to describe the rocking chair to an audience unfamiliar with Sam Maloof. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
        "explanation": "Choice A effectively describes the rocking chair made by Sam Maloof, highlighting its sleek, contoured armrests and seat, and linking it to the American woodworker.

Economist Trevon Logan showed, however, that a close look at the available data disproves this supposition.",
        "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. 'Surmised' means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence.

        "paragraph": "Several scholars have argued that conditions in England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries—namely, burgeoning literacy amid running conflicts between England’s Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and Danish invaders—were especially conducive to the production of the Old English epic poem Beowulf, and they have dated the poem’s composition accordingly. It is not inconceivable that Beowulf emerged from such a context, but privileging contextual fit over the linguistic evidence of an eighth- or even seventh-century composition requires a level of justification that thus far has not been presented.",
        "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text suggests that while Beowulf could have been composed in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries, there is linguistic evidence pointing to an earlier composition in the seventh or eighth century. Advocates for the later composition date have not convincingly addressed this evidence, indicating that the main idea is that while a later date is plausible, proponents of this view have not adequately tackled evidence supporting an earlier date.",

        "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, 'serene' most nearly means peaceful. The text describes a man in a busy city who remains calm and unaffected by the noise, conveying a sense of peace and tranquility. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts 'serene' can mean chaotic, in this passage, it refers to the man's peaceful demeanor amidst the bustling city. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts 'serene' can mean annoyed, the text portrays the man as calm and composed, not irritated. Choice D is incorrect.

        "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Charities that compensate donors for nuisance costs are largely independent of donation size, meaning they are not directly linked to the size of the donation. This leads to charities favoring attracting a few large donors over many small donors.",

Dorian passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time.

The narrator describes Dorian as being delighted by what he sees in the portrait, with his cheeks flushing with pleasure and a look of joy in his eyes.

They greeted her as an old friend. Soon she reached the river-side.",
        "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and welcoming, as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees.

In this context, 'concede' means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe 'Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.' But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included 'valuable objects signaling a high position of power,' which would raise the possibility that 'women may have also held leadership roles.'
