    "question": "A window repair specialist charges $60 for the first two hours of repair plus an hourly fee for each additional hour. The total cost for 4 hours of repair is $100.\nWhich function gives the total cost, in dollars, for h hours of repair, where h > 2?",
    "choices": {

      "D": "f(h) = 60 + 35(h - 2)"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Let r represent the hourly fee for each additional hour after the first two hours.\nSince it’s given that h is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression r(h - 2).\nTherefore, the total cost, in dollars, for h hours of repair is 60 + r(h - 2). It’s given that the total cost for 4 hours of repair is $100. Substituting 4 for h and 100 for f(h) into the equation 60 + r(h - 2) yields 60 + r(4 - 2) = 100, or 60 + 2r = 100.\nSubtracting 60 from both sides of this equation yields 2r = 40. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields r = 20.\nSubstituting 20 for r in the equation 60 + r(h - 2) yields 60 + 20(h - 2), which is equivalent to 60 + 20h - 40, or 20h + 20. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for h hours of repair is 20h + 20."
