It is not improbable that The Divan of Gülistan emerged from such a context, but prioritizing contextual fit over the linguistic evidence of a sixteenth- or even fifteenth-century composition necessitates a degree of justification that so far has not been provided.",

    "explanation": "Option D most accurately captures the main idea of the passage. The passage states that some researchers have dated the composition of The Divan of Gülistan to the late eighteenth through early nineteenth centuries due to the poem's fit with that period's historical context. The passage goes on to say that while it is \"not improbable that The Divan of Gülistan emerged from such a context\"—that is, it is possible that The Divan of Gülistan was composed during the late eighteenth through early nineteenth centuries—there is linguistic evidence that the poem was composed earlier, in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. According to the passage, favoring the historical context over the linguistic evidence requires justification that researchers have not yet supplied. In other words, the passage suggests that researchers who favor the later composition date need to explain why the poem's fit with historical context should take precedence over the linguistic evidence, but they have not yet done so. Thus, the main idea of the passage is that while there is some plausibility to the later composition date, proponents of the later date have not adequately addressed evidence suggestive of an earlier date."

Half of the participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group that was instructed to use social media for no more than 1 hour per day, while the other half served as a control group that could use social media as much as they wanted. After 6 months, the experimental group showed a significant decrease in anxiety and depression symptoms compared to the control group, suggesting that reducing social media use may alleviate mental health issues in teenagers.",

Although scholars might have inferred that a lack of ecological diversity suggested that Mayan farming practices were largely similar everywhere, the text does not suggest they also assumed there was significant variation in the crops that Mayan people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they do not already control. If scholars had assumed that the crops Mayan people cultivated varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Mayan people probably established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they did not already possess, not that the Mayan civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers would not trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their needs with those products. Instead, the text states that scholars thought the Mayan lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya had no need for marketplaces.

    "paragraph": "A 2017 study by the University of California, Berkeley revealed that people who live near busy roads are more likely to experience high blood pressure than those who live in quieter areas. The study analyzed data from over 5000 adults and found that those who were exposed to the highest levels of traffic noise had a 20% higher risk of developing high blood pressure than those who were exposed to the lowest levels. The researchers believe that the constant bombardment of traffic noise can lead to stress and inflammation, which can increase the risk of high blood pressure.",

This choice results in a punctuation error. A semicolon can only be used to link two independent clauses. However, if \"though\" is included in the second clause, it turns the second clause into a dependent clause, so a semicolon can’t be used after \"information.\"\nChoice D is incorrect.

      "D": "decrease an individual’s capacity to create fan cells."
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The text explains that fan cells—a type of brain cell—are necessary for the acquisition of new associative memories, and that activity among these cells requires a chemical known as dopamine, which the brain produces in response to rewards. Since the brain cells that enable the formation of associative memories require dopamine in order to function, and since the brain produces dopamine in response to rewards, it can be inferred that receiving a reward should likely help to increase an individual’s capacity to form associative memories.   Choice A is incorrect because the relationship between rewards and dopamine sketched by the text is that rewards result in the production of dopamine, not that they cause an individual’s capacity to utilize dopamine to decrease. Choice B is incorrect. The text suggests that receiving a reward would produce dopamine and thereby assist with associative memory formation. However, the text never suggests that associative memory involves the capacity to recognize differences between unrelated things, indicating only that associative memory involves remembering what connects those things. Choice D is incorrect because the text never discusses how fan cells are initially created and therefore provides no evidence for a conclusion about how receiving a reward would affect their creation."

    "paragraph": "Scientists studying Mars long thought the history of its crust was relatively simple. One reason for this is that geologic and climate data collected by a spacecraft showed that the crust was largely composed of basalt, likely as a result of intense volcanic activity that brought about a magma ocean, which then cooled to form the planet’s surface. A study led by Valerie Payré focused on additional information—further analysis of data collected by the spacecraft and infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface—that revealed the presence of surprisingly high concentrations of silica in certain regions on Mars. Since a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica, Payré concluded that ____",
    "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "the information about silica concentrations collected by the spacecraft is likely more reliable than the silica information gleaned from infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface.",
      "B": "high silica concentrations on Mars likely formed from a different process than that which formed the crusts of other planets.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Cooling magma would create basalt, but “a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica.” Since Mars’s crust does contain large amounts of silica, it is unlikely that Mars’s crust was formed exclusively by cooling magma. Therefore, there were likely other major geological events that created the high silica concentrations."

These murals often depict scenes of daily life, local culture, and social commentary. They serve as a unique platform for artists to express their creativity and engage with the community. While some murals are commissioned by the government or private organizations, many are created independently by local artists.",

The graph shows that the enclosure with animal A and the enclosure without animal A each began with about 85 prey animal B, and that the number of prey animal B in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student’s claim is that the reduction in prey animal B in the enclosure with animal A is “entirely attributable to the presence of animal A,” meaning that the prey animal B population wouldn’t have declined except for the presence of animal A. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without animal A also saw a substantial reduction in the number of prey animal B."

'In other words' (A) does not provide a smooth transition as it suggests a restatement of the previous sentence. 'For example' (C) is inappropriate as it signals an illustrative example, which is not the intent of the second sentence.

Before Pasteur’s time, the prevailing theory of disease transmission was known as the theory of spontaneous generation, which posited that living organisms can arise from nonliving matter. Pasteur’s experiments disproved this theory, proving instead that living organisms can only arise from pre-existing living organisms. Through his work, Pasteur discredited the theory of spontaneous generation and revolutionized the understanding of disease transmission. \nHowever, despite the immense significance of Pasteur’s contributions to science, the author also acknowledges the limitations of his work. Pasteur’s research focused primarily on the role of bacteria in disease transmission, and he did not fully appreciate the importance of viruses as disease-causing agents. In fact, it was not until the early 20th century that scientists discovered the existence of viruses.",

But biologist Karin\nKjernsmo and a team had the idea that the shifting appearance of colors might actually make it harder for other animals\nto see iridescent insects. To test this idea, the team put beetle forewings on leaves along a forest path and then asked\nhuman participants to look for them. Some of the wings were naturally iridescent. Others were painted with a\nnonchanging color from the iridescent spectrum, such as purple or blue.",

In this context, “substantiate” means to support or prove something with evidence. According to the text, the researchers proposed a new theory about the city’s origins based on newly discovered evidence. However, the text also indicates that they were unable to prove their claim because the evidence they presented contained several inconsistencies. This context suggests that the researchers couldn’t support their claim with the evidence they had.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The text focuses on the researchers’ inability to prove their claim about the founding of Anuradhapura, which was based on newly discovered evidence. Rather than conveying that the researchers simply weren’t able to “interpret,” or explain in an understandable way, their claim’s validity, the text suggests that the researchers were unable to prove their claim altogether. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that the researchers were unable to prove their claim about the founding of Anuradhapura because the evidence they presented contained several inconsistencies; this suggests that rather than being unable to “validate,” or confirm the validity of, their claim, the researchers were unable to prove their claim. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the researchers were unable to “assess,” or evaluate the quality of, their claim about the founding of Anuradhapura; the text states that the researchers were unable to prove their claim, which indicates that they did evaluate the quality of their claim."

    "paragraph": "When digging for clams, their primary food, sea otters damage the roots of eelgrass plants growing on the seafloor. Near Vancouver Island in Canada, the otter population is large and well established, yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those found elsewhere off Canada’s coast. T o explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the V ancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the V ancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant’s rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadow’s health overall.",
    "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly undermine Foster’s hypothesis?",

      "A": "At some sites in the study, eelgrass meadows are found near otter populations that are small and have only recently been reintroduced.",
      "B": "At several sites not included in the study, there are large, well-established sea otter populations but no eelgrass meadows.",
      "C": "At several sites not included in the study, eelgrass meadows’ health correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations.",
      "D": "At some sites in the study, the health of plants unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations."
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "If eelgrass meadows’ health correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations, this suggests that damage to eelgrass roots does not lead to healthier meadows.
