## Discontinued Version of OpenSAT
Looking for the latest version? [Check out OpenSAT on GitHub](https://github.com/Anas099X/OpenSAT).

This is the legacy version of OpenSAT, originally built with Node.js and Svelte. I've now transitioned to [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/) to achieve a more flexible and lightweight development approach.
