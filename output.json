  "question": {
    "paragraph": "In the late 1800s to early 1900s, it was commonly believed that larger households in the United States benefited from economies of scale regarding food expenditures, meaning they spent less on food per capita compared to smaller households. However, an analysis by economist Trevon Logan contradicts this belief, indicating that the data does not support the assumption.",
    "question_text": "What is the most accurate and precise word to fill in the blank in the following statement? 'Economic historians ___ that larger households spent less per person on food than smaller households.'"
  },
  "options": {
    "A": "surmised",
    "B": "contrived",
    "C": "questioned",
    "D": "regretted"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Option A, 'surmised,' is correct because it means to suppose something is true without having evidence to confirm it. This fits the context where economic historians made an assumption about household spending without sufficient evidence, which was later challenged by Trevon Logan's analysis."
