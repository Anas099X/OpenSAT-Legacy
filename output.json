    "paragraph": "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______",
    "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census.",
      "B": "some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.",
      "C": "Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.",
      "D": "the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did."

    "paragraph": "Based on the information provided in the passage, Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation.",
    "question": "What can be inferred about Bianchi and Morri's sensitivity to within-species variation compared to Coll and colleagues?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Bianchi and Morri were less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues.",

    "paragraph": "A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the painted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography’s impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of both full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography. Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth century?",
    "question": "Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth century?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline.",
      "B": "Although portrait miniatures became less common than photographs, they were widely regarded as having more artistic merit.",
      "C": "The popularity of the portrait miniature likely persisted for longer than art historians have assumed.",
      "D": "As demand for portrait miniatures decreased, portrait artists likely shifted their creative focus to photography."
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be 'overstated,' as some records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. From this, we can conclude that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the 'artistic merit' of either art form. Choice C is incorrect. The text never suggests that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought—if anything, it suggests that the portrait miniature started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that portrait painters shifted to become photographers."

    "question": "Which of the following is the best answer to support Martinez and colleagues' conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the Jordanelle Dam?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "The lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters.",
      "B": "There was more grass cover than forest cover in 1987.",

      "D": "Grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined."
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the Jordanelle Dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years—1987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees—grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year. Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn’t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Medium"

This quotation makes that point directly by saying to readers, “You have not known what you are.” The quotation goes on to reinforce this point using a metaphor of sleep, saying that readers have “slumber’d” and that their “eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time.” Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t suggest that readers haven’t fully understood themselves but instead characterizes readers as “immense” and “interminable.” Although immense and interminable things can be difficult to understand, this quotation doesn’t make that point. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t suggest that readers haven’t fully understood themselves but instead conveys the speaker’s regret over not having celebrated readers sooner. In fact, this quotation says nothing at all about readers themselves—it’s focused solely on the speaker’s feelings about readers. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t suggest that readers haven’t fully understood themselves; instead, this quotation makes the point that the speaker has understood readers and is determined to create “hymns” about them."

Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. Only a comparison of river segments flowing into lakes with segments flowing out of lakes can support the researchers’ conclusion.",

    "paragraph": "In a recent study led by Professor Mei Lin, researchers investigated the impact of soil microbes on the health of rice plants. They focused on bacterial wilt disease, which poses a significant threat to rice cultivation worldwide. Professor Lin and her team collected soil samples from rice fields in different regions and analyzed the microbial composition. The researchers found that certain microbes in the soil played a crucial role in inhibiting the growth of the bacteria responsible for bacterial wilt disease. These findings suggest that manipulating soil microbial communities could be a promising strategy for mitigating the impact of bacterial wilt disease on rice crops.",

In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don’t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn’t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn’t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn’t have any need for marketplaces.

    "paragraph": "In 2023, Dr. Li and her research team embarked on a mission to create a submarine capable of exploring the depths of Europa's oceans. Since Europa's ocean is covered by a thick layer of ice, traditional submarines would not be able to penetrate its surface. For three years, Dr. Li's team conducted experiments in a specialized lab to simulate the extreme conditions of Europa's underwater environment. The submarine they developed is equipped with advanced heating systems to melt through the icy crust and navigate the mysterious depths below.",
    "question": "Why would traditional submarines not be suitable for exploring Europa's oceans?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Because Europa's oceans are too shallow for traditional submarines to navigate",
      "B": "Because the ice covering Europa's ocean surface is too thick for traditional submarines to penetrate",
      "C": "Because traditional submarines lack the necessary heating systems to melt through Europa's icy crust",
      "D": "Because traditional submarines are too large to maneuver in Europa's narrow underwater passages"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the correct answer because it directly aligns with the information provided in the paragraph. The text states that Europa's ocean is covered by a thick layer of ice, making it impossible for traditional submarines to penetrate its surface. Therefore, traditional submarines would not be suitable for exploring Europa's oceans due to the thickness of the ice covering."

    "paragraph": "Copper had been mined in the US for thousands of years, but large-scale commercial mining of copper took off starting in the late 1800s. This was due to several factors. Technological advancements in the mining industry led to improvements in the production of copper. This helped the country keep up with the growing number of people wanting to buy copper starting in the 1890s. At the same time, the growth of the railroad system made the transportation of copper in large batches much easier. Several states saw rapid growth in the production of this resource, for example: ______",

    "paragraph": "Modern dog breeds are largely the result of 160 years of owners crossbreeding certain dogs in order to select for particular physical appearances. Owners often say that some breeds are also more likely than others to have particular personality traits—basset hounds are affectionate; boxers are easy to train—but Kathleen Morrill and colleagues found through a combination of owner surveys and DNA sequencing of 2,000 dogs that while physical traits are predictably heritable among purebred dogs, behavior varies widely among dogs of the same breed.",
    "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Dog breeds would not exist without many years of human intervention in dogs’ reproduction.",
      "B": "Research fails to confirm a commonly held belief about dog breeds and behavior.",
      "C": "The dog breeds most popular among owners have often changed over the past 160 years.",
      "D": "A study of dog breeds is notable for its usage of both opinion surveys and DNA sequencing."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text indicates that dog owners typically claim that some dog breeds are 'more likely than others to have particular personality traits.' In other words, the text points out that a commonly held belief about dog breeds is that their personality traits are heritable. The text then states that Kathleen Morrill and colleagues undertook research about dog trait heritability and found that 'behavior varies widely among dogs of the same breed.' Because Morrill and colleagues found evidence for variability rather than consistency in the behavior of dogs of the same breed, the statement that research fails to uphold a commonly held belief about dog breeds and behavior accurately reflects the main idea of the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that humans have long intervened in dogs’ reproduction by intentionally crossbreeding certain dogs, it doesn’t argue that such intervention is essential to the existence of dog breeds. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the popularity of any dog breeds; breeds are mentioned as having certain traits, but the text says nothing about the popularity of these breeds or traits. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text briefly mentions that Morrill and colleagues conducted a study about dog traits using both surveys and DNA sequencing, this is not the main focus of the text. The text concerns the study’s results about the heritability of dog traits, not the particular methodology used by Morrill and colleagues."
