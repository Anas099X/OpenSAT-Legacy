    "paragraph": "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______",
    "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census.",
      "B": "some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.",
      "C": "Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.",
      "D": "the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did."

  "question": {
    "paragraph": "In a recent study, marine biologists led by Coll et al. reported that the number of species of microorganisms in the oceans is substantially higher than had previously been thought. Bianchi and Morri, in contrast, reported a much lower number of species of microorganisms in the oceans. The text addresses this difference, pointing out that Coll and colleagues found evidence of many previously undescribed species of microorganisms, and noting that the inclusion of these new species in the count can explain only part of the difference between the counts reported by the two studies. ",
    "question": "Based on the passage, which of the following is a valid inference regarding the differences between the studies conducted by Coll et al. and Bianchi and Morri?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Coll and colleagues' count includes species that were not described at the time of Bianchi and Morri's study.",
      "B": "Bianchi and Morri were less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues.",
      "C": "Bianchi and Morri reported more species than Coll and colleagues due to underestimating the number of microorganism species.",
      "D": "Coll and colleagues underestimated the number of microorganism species compared to Bianchi and Morri."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct because the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were. This increased sensitivity likely led Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species, as they would classify variations within the same species rather than separate species. The passage explicitly states that the difference between the two studies cannot be fully explained by the inclusion of newly described species, indicating that other factors, such as sensitivity to within-species variation, played a role."

  "question": {
    "paragraph": "A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the painted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography’s impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of both full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.",
    "question": "Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth century?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline.",
      "B": "Although portrait miniatures became less common than photographs, they were widely regarded as having more artistic merit.",
      "C": "The popularity of the portrait miniature likely persisted for longer than art historians have assumed.",
      "D": "As demand for portrait miniatures decreased, portrait artists likely shifted their creative focus to photography."
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The text suggests that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be overstated, as some records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. This indicates that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline."

  "question": {
    "paragraph": "Believing that living in an impractical space can heighten awareness and even improve health, conceptual artists Madeline Gins and Shusaku Arakawa designed an apartment building in Japan to be more fanciful than functional. A kitchen counter is chest-high on one side and knee-high on the other; a ceiling has a door to nowhere. The effect is disorienting but invigorating: after four years there, filmmaker Nobu Yamaoka reported significant health benefits.",
    "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Although inhabiting a home surrounded by fanciful features such as those designed by Gins and Arakawa can be rejuvenating, it is unsustainable.",
      "B": "Designing disorienting spaces like those in the Gins and Arakawa building is the most effective way to create a physically stimulating environment.",
      "C": "As a filmmaker, Yamaoka has long supported the designs of conceptual artists such as Gins and Arakawa.",
      "D": "Although impractical, the design of the apartment building by Gins and Arakawa may improve the well-being of the building’s residents."
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, conceptual artists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional elements, such as uneven kitchen counters and 'a door to nowhere.' The text goes on to suggest that there may be benefits to this kind of design because filmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health benefits. Thus, although the design is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building’s residents."
