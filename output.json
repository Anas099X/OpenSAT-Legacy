    "paragraph": "A number of economic thinkers have posited that during the late 1800s to early 1900s, American families benefited from economies of scale regarding food expenditures, with the belief being that larger families incurred lower food costs per individual compared to smaller ones. Contrary to this belief, an analysis by Economist Trevon Logan, upon examining the evidence at hand, refutes this notion.",

  "options": {
    "A": "surmised",
    "B": "contrived",
    "C": "questioned",
    "D": "regretted"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Option A is correct because it aligns with the text's narrative about household food expenditures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 'Surmised' implies forming a notion or guess with scant evidence. The passage details how some economic historians 'assumed' varying food expenses for large and small families, but another economist's scrutiny of the data revealed this assumption to be incorrect. The context indicates that the historians made an unfounded assumption without adequate evidence."
