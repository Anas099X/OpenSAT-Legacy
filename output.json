    "paragraph": "In the realm of economics, there has been ongoing debate regarding the dynamics of household expenditure, particularly concerning food purchases during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the United States. Some economic historians ______ that late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households in the United States experienced an economy of scale when it came to food purchases—they assumed that large households spent less on food per person than did small households. Economist Trevon Logan showed, however, that a close look at the available data disproves this supposition.",
    "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "surmised",
      "B": "contrived",
      "C": "questioned",
      "D": "regretted"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. In this context, “surmised” means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians “assumed” that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “contrived” would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn’t supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it’s Logan and not the economic historians who “questioned,” or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians “regretted,” or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians’ emotional response to what households did in the past."

    "paragraph": "In a remote region at night, the howling of wolves grew nearer and nearer, instilling dread in the narrator. While the narrator and the horses shared this fear, the driver remained unperturbed, continually scanning the darkness. 'The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.'",
    "question": "As used in the text, what does the phrase 'not in the least disturbed' most nearly mean?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Disorganized",
      "B": "Unfazed",
      "C": "Agitated",
      "D": "Disconcerted"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B, 'Unfazed,' is the best answer because in the context of the passage, 'disturbed' refers to being alarmed or perturbed. The narrator expresses fear due to the wolves' howling, while the horses also share this fear. However, the driver remains unaffected by the impending danger, continuing to scan the darkness without any sign of alarm. Choice A, 'Disorganized,' is incorrect as the passage does not depict any disorganization; rather, it focuses on the emotional response of the characters. Choice C, 'Agitated,' and Choice D, 'Disconcerted,' are also incorrect as they imply a level of disturbance or unease which is not exhibited by the driver in the passage.",

    "paragraph": "In the heart of the bustling city, Maya found herself strolling down the familiar streets she had known since childhood. The buildings towered above her, yet they seemed to embrace her like old friends. Soon, she arrived at the city park, where memories of laughter and play flooded her mind.",
    "question": "What is the main function of the underlined portion in the text?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "It suggests that Maya feels intimidated by the towering buildings.",
      "B": "It indicates that Maya is lost and confused in the city streets.",
      "C": "It emphasizes Maya’s deep connection to her childhood surroundings.",
      "D": "It conveys Maya’s longing for new experiences in the city."
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text. The passage depicts Maya's sense of familiarity and comfort in the city streets, akin to meeting old friends. This highlights her deep connection to her childhood surroundings, emphasizing a sense of belonging. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect as they misinterpret Maya's feelings and the tone of the passage. Maya is not intimidated, lost, or longing for new experiences, but rather feels embraced and nostalgic."

  "question": {
    "paragraph": "Research conducted by economist Marco Castillo and his team revealed that nuisance costs, which refer to the time and effort individuals expend to make charitable donations, have a dampening effect on charitable giving. To counteract this phenomenon, charities have the option of reimbursing donors for these nuisance costs. However, it is observed that these costs, while they vary, are predominantly _____ donation size. Consequently, charities that opt to compensate donors for these costs are likely to prioritize attracting a few large donors over numerous small donors.",
    "question": "Which choice best completes the sentence with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "supplemental to",
      "B": "predictive of",
      "C": "independent of",
      "D": "subsumed in"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the correct answer. The passage suggests that nuisance costs are not directly correlated with donation size, as compensating donors for these costs would lead to the attraction of large donors over small ones. Choice A is incorrect as it implies that nuisance costs are in addition to donation size, which contradicts the passage's logic. Choice B is incorrect as it suggests that nuisance costs can forecast donation size, which is not supported by the passage. Choice D is also incorrect as it implies that nuisance costs are included within donation size, which does not align with the passage's reasoning."
