    "paragraph": "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______",
    "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census.",
      "B": "some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.",
      "C": "Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.",
      "D": "the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did."

    "paragraph": "Recent studies suggest that previous estimates of the number of microorganism species in the oceans were too low. Coll and colleagues found many more microorganism species than did Bianchi and Morri, whose count was approximately one-quarter as high as Coll and colleagues’. The difference between the two counts cannot be fully explained by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the number of new invertebrate species described in the years between the two studies can account for only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies.",
    "question": "According to the passage, what cannot fully account for the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count of microorganism species and Bianchi and Morri’s count?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "The inclusion of new invertebrate species in Coll and colleagues’ count",
      "B": "The failure of Bianchi and Morri to report all of the microorganism species that they found",
      "C": "Bianchi and Morri’s less sensitivity to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were",
      "D": "An underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger."

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement, providing an example of how the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live. The table shows the average highest temperatures and average lowest temperatures in four locations in the Navajo Nation in July. According to the table, Ramah’s average highest temperature for July was 83°, whereas Cameron’s average highest temperature was much higher, at 99°. This difference illustrates the statement that the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live."

    "paragraph": "German theater practitioner Bertolt Brecht (1898–1956) believed that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, provoking them to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted onstage. Brecht’s influence can be seen in English playwright Caryl Churchill’s 1979 play Cloud 9: although the play sometimes invites empathetic reactions, it primarily works to engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism, which it does by placing audiences at a distance, thereby encouraging them to ______",
    "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "focus on the characters’ beliefs about social and political issues as revealed by the characters’ actions.",
      "B": "reflect on social and political phenomena not directly related to patriarchy and colonialism.",
      "C": "recognize pertinent social and political parallels between Germany during Brecht’s time and England at the time when Churchill was writing Cloud 9.",
      "D": "be dispassionate as they think critically about the social and political questions raised by the play."
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. Churchill’s play was influenced by Brecht’s belief that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, making them think about social and political issues that also exist outside of the play. Therefore, it makes sense that Churchill would strive to have audiences think dispassionately (i.e., without emotion) and critically about the social and political questions raised by the play."

    "paragraph": "During the past two centuries, the proportion of individuals engaged in agricultural work has diminished in both France and the United States, while the service industry, encompassing various fields such as retail, consulting, and real estate, has witnessed a surge in employment. However, this transition unfolded at contrasting paces in the two nations. This contrast is most evident when examining the employment distribution across sectors in ______",
    "question": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "1900 with the employment by sector in 1950.",
      "B": "1800 with the employment by sector in 2012.",

      "D": "1800 with the employment by sector in 1900."
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Option A is the optimal answer as it integrates data from the table to accurately conclude the statement regarding the divergent rates of sectoral transition in France and the United States. The provided text indicates a common trend of declining agricultural employment and rising service sector employment in both countries over the past two centuries. Nonetheless, it emphasizes the substantial differences in the pace of this transition between the two nations. By juxtaposing data from 1900 and 1950, it becomes evident that the rate of change was more pronounced in the United States compared to France for both sectors. Specifically, in France, agricultural employment decreased by 11 percentage points (from 43% to 32%) and service sector employment increased by 7 percentage points (from 28% to 35%), whereas in the United States, agricultural employment declined by 27 percentage points (from 41% to 14%) and service sector employment surged by 22 percentage points (from 31% to 53%). This comparison underscores the disparity in the pace of sectoral transition between the two countries."

The researchers based their conclusion on the discovery of cattle bones with high nitrogen isotope levels, indicating that the cattle consumed crops grown near the settlements. Additionally, the team found that the diets of sheep, goats, and cattle varied based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow.",

      "D": "The variability in the diets of sheep, goats, and cattle based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow."
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C provides the strongest evidence against the team’s conclusion because it suggests that cattle were not necessarily raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. If cattle were capable of meeting their dietary requirements from food located far from human settlements, it undermines the argument that the presence of cattle bones with high nitrogen isotope levels near settlements indicates proximity to human settlements. This weakens the team’s conclusion and suggests that factors other than proximity to human settlements may have influenced the distribution of livestock. Choices A, B, and D do not directly challenge the team’s conclusion and therefore do not provide as strong evidence against it."

The paragraph highlights how historians wrongly believed that the people's telepathic abilities rendered traditional communication devices unnecessary.

    "paragraph": "The text suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don’t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn’t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn’t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn’t have any need for marketplaces. The scholars’ mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products.",
