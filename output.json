    "paragraph": "A number of economic thinkers have posited that during the late 1800s to early 1900s, American families benefited from economies of scale concerning food expenditures, with the belief being that larger families incurred lower food costs per individual compared to smaller ones. Contrary to this belief, an in-depth examination of the data by Economist Trevon Logan reveals that this notion is unfounded.",

  },
  "options": {
    "A": "surmised",

    "C": "questioned",
    "D": "regretted"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Option A, 'surmised,' is the correct choice as it logically fits the context of the paragraph, indicating that the economic thinkers formed a hypothesis with limited evidence.

  "question": {
    "paragraph": "In the chilling narrative of Bram Stoker's classic 'Dracula', set in 1897, our storyteller recounts a nocturnal journey by carriage through an isolated area. The howling of wolves grows increasingly intense, as if they are encircling us from all directions. My own terror mounts, and the horses, sensing my dread, become equally terrified. Yet, the coachman remains utterly unfazed; despite constantly scanning the murky shadows on either side, the darkness reveals nothing.",
    "query": "In the context of the passage, the term 'disturbed' is best interpreted as?"
  },
  "options": {
    "A": "Disorganized",
    "B": "Alarmed",
    "C": "Offended",
    "D": "Interrupted"
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Option B is correct as 'disturbed' in the passage most closely aligns with being alarmed. The scene depicts the narrator and the horses experiencing intense fear during their travel, in stark contrast to the coachman who remains calm and collected, not showing any signs of alarm amidst the howling wolves."

  "question": {
    "paragraph": "In Srimati Svarna Kumari Devi’s novel from 1894, 'The Fatal Garland', translated in 1910, we follow Shakti as she traverses a familiar woodland path leading to a riverbank, a place of her childhood memories. As she navigates through the forest, the trees appear to reach out with their limbs in a gesture of welcome, recognizing her as a cherished acquaintance. Shortly thereafter, she arrives at the riverside.",
    "query": "What is the best description of the role of the highlighted section within the overall context of the passage?"
  },
  "options": {
    "A": "It implies that Shakti is uneasy in the vicinity of the river.",
    "B": "It suggests that Shakti is disoriented within the forest.",
    "C": "It underscores Shakti's feeling of connection to the natural surroundings.",
    "D": "It reflects Shakti's gratitude towards enduring personal relationships."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Option C is correct as it most accurately captures the essence of the underlined sentence within the context of the passage. The initial sentence establishes Shakti's deep knowledge of the forest. The underlined sentence further highlights her intimate bond with the woods, portraying the branches as amiable and 'welcoming,' akin to arms outstretched in greeting. The passage continues to depict Shakti's ease and happiness among the trees, reinforcing her status as a venerable companion of the forest. Therefore, the underlined section's purpose is to accentuate Shakti's ingrained sense of attachment to the wooded environment she frequents."

  "question": {
    "paragraph": "Research by economist Marco Castillo and his team has revealed that the burdens of time and effort required to contribute to charities—known as nuisance costs—can decrease the amount of charitable contributions. While charities can lessen this impact by reimbursing these nuisance costs to donors, these expenses, despite being variable, are predominantly disconnected from the size of donations. Consequently, charities that offer compensation for these costs are more inclined to draw in a handful of substantial donors rather than numerous smaller ones.",
    "query": "What is the most logical and precise word or phrase to fill in the blank?"
  },
  "options": {
    "A": "supplemental to",
    "B": "predictive of",
    "C": "independent of",
    "D": "subsumed in"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Option C is correct because the passage indicates that charities compensating for nuisance costs tend to attract larger donors, implying that nuisance costs do not vary with the size of the donation. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they suggest a relationship between nuisance costs and donation size, which the passage contradicts."
